The importance of information collection in penetration testing is self-evident. Subdomain collection is an essential and very important part of information collection. At present, there are many open source tools for subdomain collection on the Internet, but there are always some of the following problems:

* **Not powerful enough**Ôºåthere are not enough interfaces to collect subdomains automatically, and there are no functions such as automatic subdomain resolve, verification, FUZZ and information expansion.
* **Not friendly enough**Ôºåalthough the command line module is more convenient, but when there are a lot of optional parameters and the operation to be implemented is complex, using command line mode is a bit unfriendly. If there is a good interaction, With a highly operable front end, the experience will be much better.

* **Lack of maintenance**ÔºåMany tools have not been updated once in years, what issues and PR are, do not exist.

* **Efficiency issues**Ôºådo not take advantage of multi-process, multi-threading and asynchronous cooperation technology, the speed is slow.

In order to solve the above pain points, As its name suggests, I want OneForAll to be a collection of 100 strong, powerful and fast subdomains that collect the ultimate artifact üî®.

At present, OneForAll is still under development, there must be a lot of problems and areas for improvement. Welcome to submit [Issues](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/pulls)ÔºåIf you like, give it to a little star ‚ú®ÔºåAt present, there is a special QQ group for OneForAll communication and feedback: üë®‚Äçüë®‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶Ôºö:[**824414244**](//shang.qq.com/wpa/qunwpa?idkey=125d3689b60445cdbb11e4ddff38036b7f6f2abbf4f7957df5dddba81aa90771)ÔºåYou can also [tweet](https://twitter.com/shmilylty) to me .

## üëçFeatures

* **Powerful collection capability**ÔºåFor more information, please see [collection module description](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/docs/collection_modules.md).
  1. Collect subdomains using certificate transparency (there are currently 6 modules: `censys_api`Ôºå`certspotter`Ôºå`crtsh`Ôºå`entrust`Ôºå`google`Ôºå`spyse_api`Ôºâ

  2. General check collection subdomains (there are currently 4 modules: domain transfer vulnerability exploitation`axfr`, cross-domain policy file `cdx`, HTTPS certificate `cert`, content security policy `csp`, robots file `robots`, and sitemap file `sitemap`. Check NSEC record, NSEC3 record and other modules will be added later).

  3.  Collect subdomains using web crawler files (there are currently 2 modules: `archirawl`, `commoncrawl`, which is still being debugged and needs to be added and improved). 

  4.  Collect subdomains using DNS datasets (there are currently 23 modules: `binaryedge_api`, `bufferover`, `cebaidu`, `chinaz`, `chinaz_api`, `circl_api`, `dnsdb_api`, `dnsdumpster`, `hackertarget`, `ip138`, `ipv4info_api`, `netcraft`, `passivedns_api`, `ptrarchive`, `qianxun`, `rapiddns`, `riddler`, `robtex`, `securitytrails_api`, `sitedossier`, `threatcrowd`, `wzpc`, `ximcx`Ôºâ

  5.  Collect subdomains using DNS queries (There are currently 5 modules: collecting subdomains `srv` by enumerating common SRV records and making queries, and collecting subdomains by querying MX,NS,SOA,TXT records in DNS records of domain names). 

  6.  Collect subdomains using threat intelligence platform data (there are currently 6 modules: `alienvault`, `riskiq_ api`, `threatbook_ api`, `threatkeeper `, `virustotal`, `virustotal_ api`, which need to be added and improved).

  7.  Use search engines to discover subdomains (there are currently 18 modules: `ask`, `baidu`, `bing`, `bing_api`, `duckduckgo`, `exalead`, `fofa_api`, `gitee`, `github`, `github_api`, `google`, `google_api`, `shodan_api`, `so`, `sogou`, `yahoo`, `yandex`, `zoomeye_api`), except for special search engines in the search module. General search engines support automatic exclusion of search, full search, recursive search. 
* **Support subdomain blasting**ÔºåThis module has both conventional dictionary blasting and custom fuzz mode. It supports batch blasting and recursive blasting, and automatically judges pan-parsing and processing.
* **Support subdmain verification**Ôºådefault to enable subdomain verification, automatically resolve subdomain DNS, automatically request subdomain to obtain title and banner, and comprehensively determine subdomain survival.
* **Support subdomain takeover**ÔºåBy default, subdomain takeover risk checking is enabled. Automatic subdomain takeover is supported (only Github, remains to be improved at present), and batch inspection is supported.
* **Powerful processing feature**ÔºåThe found subdomain results support automatic removal, automatic DNS parsing, HTTP request detection, automatic filtering of valid subdomains, and expansion of Banner information for subdomains. The final supported export formats are `rst`, `csv`, `tsv`, `json`, `yaml`, `html`, `xls`, `xlsx`, `dbf`, `latex`, `ods`.
* **Very fast**Ôºå[collection module](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/oneforall//collect.py) uses multithreaded calls, [blasting module](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/oneforall/brute.py) uses [massdns](https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns), the speed can at least reach 10000pps under the default configuration, and DNS parsing and HTTP requests use asynchronous multiprogramming in subdomain verification. Multithreaded check [subdomain takeover](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/oneforall/takeover.py) risk.
* **Good experience**ÔºåEach module has a progress bar, and the results of each module are saved asynchronously.

## üöÄStart Guide

üì¢ Please take a moment to read this document to help you quickly get familiar with OneForAll!

**üêçInstallation requirements**

OneForAll is developed and tested based on [Python 3.8.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/). Please use a stable release higher than Python 3.8.0, other versions may have some problems (Windows platform must use Python 3.8.0 or later). For more information on installing the Python environment, please see [Python 3 installation Guide](https://pythonguidecn.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/starting/installation.html#python-3) . Run the following command to check the Python and pip3 versions:
```bash
python -V
pip3 -V
```
If you see the following output, there is no problem with the Python environment:
```bash
Python 3.8.0
pip 19.2.2 from C:\Users\shmilylty\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\site-packages\pip (python 3.8)
```

**‚úîInstallation steps (Git version)**

1. **Download**
   
   This project has been mirrored in [Gitee](https://gitee.com/shmilylty/OneForAll.git). If you are in China, it is recommended that you use Gitee for cloning, which is faster:

   ```bash
   git clone https://gitee.com/shmilylty/OneForAll.git
   ```
   orÔºö
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll.git
   ```

2. **Installation**

   Since the project is under development and will continue to be updated iteratively, `git clone` is used to clone the latest code repository during download, which is also convenient for subsequent updates. Downloading from Releases is not recommended because the update of the version in Releases is slow and inconvenient.
   
   You can install OneForAll dependencies via pip3 (if you are familiar with [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/), then it is recommended that you use [pipenv install dependencies](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/docs/Installation_dependency.md), the following is an example of using **pip3** to install dependencies under **Windows system**: (Note: If your Python3 is installed in the system Program Files In the directory, such as: `C:\Program Files\Python38`, then run the command prompt cmd as an administrator to execute the following command!)
```bash
   cd OneForAll/
   python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   cd oneforall/
   python oneforall.py --help
```
‚Äã      For other system platforms, please refer to [dependency installation](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/docs/installation_dependency.md). If you find that compiling a dependent library fails during the installation dependencies, Refer to the solution in the [troubleshooting.md](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/docs/troubleshooting.md) documentation, if not resolved, welcome feedback.

3. **Update**

   ‚ùóNote: If you have cloned the project before, please **back** up your own modified files (such as **config.py**) to the location outside the project before updating, then execute the following command **update** project:

   ```bash
   git fetch --all
   git reset --hard origin/master
   git pull
   ```

**‚úîInstallation steps (Docker version)**

Method 1: directly pull the deployed image (not updated in time)

```shell
docker pull tardis07/oneforall
docker run -it oneforall
```

Method 2: build from `Dockerfile` (same as git version)

```shell
docker build -t oneforall .
docker run -it oneforall
```

**‚ú®Demonstration**

1. If you are installing dependencies through pip3, run the example using the following command: 
    ```bash
    cd oneforall/
    python3 oneforall.py --target example.com run
    ```

    ![Example](./docs/usage_example.svg)

2. If you install dependencies through pipenv, run the example using the following command: 
   ```bash
   cd oneforall/
   pipenv run python oneforall.py --target example.com run
   ```

**üßêDescription**. 

Let's take the command `python3 oneforall.py-- target example.com run` as an example. After the default parameters are executed normally, OneForAll will generate the corresponding results in the results directory: 

![Result](./images/Result.png)

`example.com.csv` is the result of subdomain collection under each primary domain. 

`all_subdomain_result_1583034493.csv` is the summary result of the sub-domain collected by OneForAll each time, including `example.com.csv`. It is convenient to obtain all the results in batch collection scenarios. 

`result.sqlite3` is the SQLite3 result database that stores the sub-domain collected by OneForAll each time you run SQLite3. The database structure is shown below: 

![Database](./images/Database.png)

A table like `example_com_origin_result` stores the initial subdomain collection results of each module. 

A table like `example_com_resolve_result` stores the results of resolving subdomains.

A table like `example_com_last_result` stores the results of the last sub-domain collection (it needs to be collected more than twice before it is generated). 

A table like `example_com_now_result` stores the collection results of the current subdomain. In general, you just need to pay attention to this table.

**ü§îHelp**

The command line parameters only provide some common parameters. For more detailed parameter configuration, please see [config.py](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/oneforall/config.py) if you think Some parameters are frequently used in the command interface or missing parameters. Feedback is welcome. For well-known reasons, if you want to use some of the wall's collection interface, please go to [config.py](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/oneforall/config.py) to configure the proxy, some collection Modules need to provide APIs (most of which are freely available for registered accounts). If you need to use them, please go to [api.py](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/oneforall/api.py) to configure the API. Information, if not used, please ignore the error message. (For detailed modules, please read [collection module description](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/docs/collection_modules.md))

The OneForAll command line interface is based on [Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire/). For more advanced usage of Fire, please refer to [using the Fire CLI](https://github.com/google/Python-fire/blob/master/docs/using-cli.md), if you have any doubts during the use, please feel free to give me feedback.

[oneforall.py](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/oneforall/oneforall.py) is the main program entry, and oneforall.py can call [brute.py](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/oneforall/brute.py), [takerover.py](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/oneforall/takerover.py) and [dbexport.py ](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/oneforall/dbexport.py) and other modules, in order to facilitate the sub-field blasting, brute.py is isolated independently, in order to facilitate the subdomain takeover risk check independently takeover.py, in order to facilitate the database export independently dbexport.py, these modules can be run separately, and the parameters accepted are more abundant, if you want to use these modules separately, please refer to the [usage help](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/docs/usage_help.en.md).

‚ùó Note: When you encounter some problems or doubts during use, please use [Issues](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/issues) to search for answers. Also see [Q&troubleshooting.md](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/docs/Q&troubleshooting.md).
